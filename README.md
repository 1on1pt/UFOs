# UFOs
Building dynamic webpages by using JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, basic HTML, and chrome developer tools.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to (1) build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, (2) create filters to make this table fully dynamic, and then (3) place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.  The benefit of a table that is *fully dynamic* is that it will react to user input.

The webpage was customized using Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.

Dana, who is a data journalist, developed a webpage and dynamic table that provides information to answer the question: UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?  Her table is working as intended, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, she added table filters for:

  * City
  * State
  * Country
  * Shape
