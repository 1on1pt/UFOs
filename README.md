# UFOs
Building dynamic webpages by using JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, basic HTML, and Chrome developer tools.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to:

1. Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array.
2. Create filters to make this table fully dynamic.
3. Place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

The benefit of a table that is *fully dynamic* is that it will react to user input.  The webpage was customized using Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.

Dana, who is a data journalist, developed a webpage with a dynamic table that provides information to explore the question: UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?  Her table is working as intended, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, she added table filters for:

  * City
  * State
  * Country
  * Shape

### Resources
**Code:**

* app.js
* index.html

**Data:**

* data.js

**Software:**

* JavaScript
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* Chrome Developer Tools
* Visual Studio Code 1.65.1


## Results
The new and improved **UFO Sightings: The Truth is Out There** webpage is now live and ready to be used by all ufologists!  As you recall, the original version of the webpage only could be filtered by *date*.  But this update includes these additional filtering capabilities:
 * City
 * State
 * Country
 * Shape

As you travel through *cyberspace*, you will ultimately *land* on this *unfiltered* webpage:

The unfiltered webpage allows you to scroll and browse through the database of UFO sightings.  Use of the **Filter Search** allows the user to narrow a search based on date, city, state, country, or shape.

A visitor to the webpage may choose one or more filters by entering the in the appropriate format.  For example, date is entered in the 1/10/2010 format and city, state, country, and shape entries are entered with a small case first letter.  Typing "1/12/2010" into the date filter and hitting ENTER will give the following eight results:

But this particular search could be further refined if there is only an interest in UFO sightings in the State of Oregon on 1/12/2010.  In addition to typing in the date of 1/12/2020, **"or"** is entered in the Enter State filter followed by hitting the ENTER key for the following two results:
